# GitHub Issue Templates

This directory stores templates for GitHub Issues to help contributors provide structured and comprehensive information when reporting bugs or requesting features.

Using these templates ensures that all necessary details are captured, streamlining the process of understanding, reproducing, and addressing issues or proposals.

## Standard Templates

- **`bug_report.md`**: Use this template when you've found a bug, an error, or unexpected behavior in the PDB-MCP application or its documentation. It prompts for steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior, environment details, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

- **`feature_request.md`**: Use this template when you have an idea for a new feature, an enhancement to an existing one, or a general improvement. It asks for a description of the problem the feature would solve, a proposal for the solution, any alternatives considered, and the potential impact or benefits.

By providing these standardized forms, we aim to make the contribution process clearer and more efficient for everyone involved in the PDB-MCP project.
