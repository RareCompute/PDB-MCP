PDB-MCP in One Sentence

PDB-MCP (Protein-Data-Bank Model Context Provider) is an open micro-service that lets AI agents tap the RCSB PDB—the world’s 3-D protein archive—through a standards-based MCP interface. Educators, researchers, and startups gain instant, token-light access to structure summaries, paving the way for smarter BioML workflows.

Why Fast Structural Access Matters

BioML (Biological Machine Learning) models hunger for curated 3-D data. Traditional downloads are bulky and rate-limited, slowing design loops in immunotherapy, oncology, and enzyme engineering. PDB-MCP delivers right-sized context bundles—title, method, resolution, ligands—so RL (Reinforcement Learning) design agents can iterate in seconds, not hours.
Illustration: Split panel—left shows a snail dragging a giant PDB file; right shows a rocket receiving a compact JSON packet.

Our Guiding Principles
	1.	Open—MIT-licensed code, CC-BY-4.0 data.
	2.	Inclusive—runs locally on a laptop or in Kubernetes.
	3.	Composable—plugs into any MCP-aware LLM.
	4.	Reproducible—built-in provenance for every query.
Together these principles democratize discovery for classrooms and cutting-edge labs alike.

Inside a Dynamic Dataset

An agent calls get_structure("1ABC"); PDB-MCP returns a 2 KB JSON: chains, organism, resolution, plus a ligand list with counts. Agents remix these slices into function-specific datasets—say, kinase active-sites—with zero manual curation. Metadata stays FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) by design.
Illustration: A chef-bot combining small labelled bowls (chains, ligands, resolution) into a platter marked “Kinase Set”.

How the Service Works

Step-by-step:
	1.	Agent sends JSON-RPC via MCP.
	2.	FastAPI server queries RCSB PDB once, caches the result.
	3.	Pydantic models validate & compress data.
	4.	Agent receives schema-guaranteed context—no scraping required.
	5.	RL tuner scores outcomes; agent tweaks queries, closing the learn-design-test loop.

Pilot: Smarter Immunotherapy Leads

A student team at Cedars will use the system to find and process immuno therapy compounds, great acclerating time to deploy new spatial multi-omics therparies.

Roadmap to Scale

Q3 2025: Redis cache + full-text search.
Q1 2026: GraphQL batching & computed AlphaFold models.
2026-2027: Federation into the OpenBioML Network so classrooms worldwide share cached slices, cutting compute costs by 70 %.
